## Fifteen

The Game of Fifteen is a puzzle played on a square, two-dimensional board with numbered tiles that slide. The goal of this puzzle is to arrange the board’s tiles from smallest to largest, left to right, top to bottom, with an empty space in board’s bottom-right corner.
Sliding any tile that borders the board’s empty space in that space constitutes a "move".
Size of the board can 3 - 9.
